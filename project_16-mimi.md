# Mimi

## Introduction

Mimi is a sweatheart that helps you doing common/daily tasks without the use of
the keyboard.

## Description

Mimi is like a "siri" or a "cortana" or "ok google" with the exception that it
only lives in chrome.
It has out-of-the-box a set of tasks like checking your email, browsing stuff
on the web, taking pictures, screenshots, saving bookmarks and some other
cool stuff.
By the end of the day Mimi will be the first and last company you'll have day
in and day out since, more than everything, the browser is always there.
Mimi is built using only native apis offered by chrome.
