# Pingamos

## Introduction

Advertise an event to people in a short/medium range (e.g. giveaways and instant sales)

## Description

Our project enables people to announce events near them to people that might be interested in their vicinity.
Our audience is everyone. From regular people just wanting to share a giveaway that's happening, to local companies advertising special events, to big corporations who want to advertise special sales on a special shop.
Right now we are writing our backend in python (with a more performant and probably not working in time version in golang), our frontend in Cordova and OutSystems, using Firebase Cloud Messaging for the push notifications, and Unbabel to make it available in the most languages.

None at least for now

## Other information

Our project pitch will probably have to be in portuguese due to the nature of it's name and current slogan.
