# CardioRemote

## Introduction

We are building a TV remote with embedded Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Photoplethismography (PPG) sensors to measure your blood pressure, heart rate and oxigen saturation.

## Description

Imagine if you no longer had to measure your blood pressure with those inflating things aka sphygmomanometer! 
Recent research has shown that with only ECG and PPG sensors we are able to get accurate readings of systolic blood pressure.
We are developing a TV remote controller with embedded sensors so that everytime you grab your remote it will measure:
* heart rate
* oxigen saturation
* systolic blood pressure

But why is this important?
Heart failure (HF) is considered one of the major public health problems of the 21st century. 
One of the main ways to prevent this disease is by regularly measuring blood pressure and weight. With our TV remote we want to make
the way people monitor this disease easier and less intrusive.
The audience is basically everyone with more than 50 years old, but especially people diagnosed with hypertension or any other heart related disease.

The technology used in this project includes:

HARDWARE
* ECG sensor
* PPG sensor
* PCB with ARM controller, ADC to acquire the signals and Bluetooth
* Wireless power (to charge the remote)

SOFTWARE
* Python (back-end)
* Websockets communication
* HTML5, CSS and JS (front-end)
* SOLIDWORKS (to draw 3D of remote controller)
