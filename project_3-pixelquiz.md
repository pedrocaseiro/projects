## Introduction

Pixelquiz is a multiplayer quiz game.

## Description

Pixelquiz is a multiplayer quiz game where you need to beat the clock to guess what an image is. The thing is that the image starts heavily pixelized and as the clock ticks, it gets less pixelized.

We are using React & Redux for the UI and Node for the backend.
