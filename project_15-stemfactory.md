# StemFactory

## Introduction

StemFactory is a web based business simulation game where players control a stem cell manufacturing facility to cure people and earn profit.

## Description

StemFactory creates a scenery to simulate real-life manufacturing challenges in the promising field of stem cell therapies, with applications in diverse medical conditions.

The audience is the general public in order to raise awareness to the main problems in this area: expensive production costs, low profit margins and low capacity to reach widespread medical application.

To accomplish StemFactory we used Python (Numpy, Simpy, Scipy, Pandas and CherryPy) for the back-end and HTML, CSS and Javascript for the front-end.
